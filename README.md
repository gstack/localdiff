localdiff
=========

a simple node js file watcher that keeps automatic diffs of files as they are changed. (wip)

# Testing the development version

part of npm's nice simplicity - pull the development code straight from github

## Installation

```
npm install -g gstack/localdiff

```

## Usage

Once installed just run:

```
localdiff
```

in any source code folder, it will create a .localdiff directory where all the scraps / revision history will be stored.
