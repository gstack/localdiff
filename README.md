localdiff
=========

in any source code folder, it will create a .localdiff directory where all the scraps / revision history will be stored. a webserver will be started to show a sexy bootstrap interface, detailing what you changed. (diff for every revision of the file + optionally storing that copy of the file for later use. Ain't it easy mang?)

a simple node js file watcher that keeps automatic diffs of files as they are changed. (wip)

# Testing the development version

part of npm's nice simplicity - pull the development code straight from github
